# gSchool and Go

## What is Go

## Why Go

Go was created to solve problems of scale.  Not just machine scale, but human
scale as well.  In today's software world, cycles matter.  Every time a developer
has to wait for a test suite to run, or a build to finish, it costs money.

Let us do some simple math.  If we pay a developer a $90,000 salary, that is the
equivalent of $0.72 an hour.  If, on average, a developer waits 20 minutes per
day for testing and compiling to complete, that is $72/week, or $3,750.  Now, that
doesn't sound horrible, but if you take that across a team of 100 developers, now
$375,000 per year.  Considering that in many languages, we spend much more time
than that waiting for tests and builds, it's even worse.  I can't imagine what
it costs Google annually.

## What are companies using Go for

## Am I ready to learn Go at gSchool

If you have at least 2 years of production software experience,
the answer is yes!  With a 12 week compressed curriculum, its important
that you already have some base level of software knowledge.

## Why choose gSchool to learn Go

gSchool is more than just a classroom with expert instructors.  We believe
that modern education should be taught in the same environment that a
student will work in when graduating.  Placing classrooms inside of Galvanize
allows students to interact with companies outside of class that are working
with their technology.  This close proximity builds a network that students
take with them into their careers.  We have several partnerships with leading
local technology

We teach modern software design with the tools the industry is currently using,
such as git and github.com, Pivotal Tracker, Atom.io, advanced command line
usage, and much more.
